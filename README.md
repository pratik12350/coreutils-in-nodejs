# Coreutils in nodejs

Im trying to make most of the linux coreutils command in nodejs (which are possible). Currently i have no project and im bored so im made this thing ðŸ˜‚.
I know it **slow** and some commands lack some features of actual command but anyways, who cares? This is just a timepass project.

## How to download?

Bruh, just clone the repo or download a single file if you need of command then execute `$ node <fileName.js>`

or if you're on linux then just use `$ chmod +x fileName.js` then `$ ./fileName.js <args>`

## Commands added

- ls
- cat
- mkdir

## Commands need to add

### we need contributers for some command, make a pull request if you can make one of these commands!
