# Coreutils in nodejs

Im trying to make most of the linux coreutils command in nodejs (which are possible). Currently i have no project and im bored so im make this thing ðŸ˜‚.
I know it **slow** and some commands lack some features of actual command but anyways, who cares? This is just a timepass project.

## How to download?
 Bruh, just clone the repo or download a single file if you need of command then execute `$ node <fileName.js>`

 or if you're on linux then just use `$ chmod +x fileName.js` then `$ fileName.js`

## Commands added
- ls
- cat
